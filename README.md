# timer-automation
The pomodoro timer is one of my favorite productivity tools that I deploy when I'm doing school work, programming and many other tasks. However, sometimes I get lazy and forget to open the timer app which leads me to zoning out and being unproductive. To prevent this, I created a simple program that automates setting up one of the most important things in my work environment, the pomodoro timer!
